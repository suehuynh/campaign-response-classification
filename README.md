# Marketing Campaign Response Prediction
This repository contains the code and data for a project that explores marketing campaign data from 2020 in order to predict the response of customers in the most recent campaign. The project makes use of data exploration, data visualization, and machine learning algorithms in order to develop an accurate prediction model.

## Introduction 
The goal of this project is to predict customer response to marketing campaigns using data from previous campaigns. In order to do this, we will use a variety of machine learning algorithms and explore the data to identify patterns and trends that may be useful in our analysis.

## Data
The dataset used in this project contains information on marketing campaigns conducted in 2020. The data includes information on customer demographics, purchase history, and campaign response. The dataset is available in the data folder and is provided in a CSV and Excel format.

## Analysis
The project makes use of various data exploration and visualization techniques in order to identify patterns and trends in the data. This includes visualizations such as scatter plots, bar charts, and histograms.

After exploring the data, we use a variety of machine learning algorithms to develop a predictive model for customer response to the most recent campaign. We train and evaluate the performance of several models, including linear regression, logistic regression, decision trees, random forests, and KNN.

## Results
Our analysis shows that the best performing model for predicting customer response is a logistic regression, which achieves an accuracy of 85%. 

## Installation
To run this project locally, you will need to have Python 3 installed on your machine. You can download Python from the official website: https://www.python.org/downloads/.

Once you have Python installed, you can clone this repository using the following command:


```git clone https://github.com/your-username/marketing-campaign-prediction.git```

After cloning the repository, navigate to the project directory and install the required dependencies by running the following command:

```pip install -r requirements.txt```

## Usage
To run the project, navigate to the project directory and run the following command:
```python main.py```

This will start the data exploration and machine learning process. The resulting prediction model will be saved to the models folder.
